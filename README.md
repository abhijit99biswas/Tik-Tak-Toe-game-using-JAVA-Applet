# Tik-Tak_Tow-game-using-JAVA-Applet
------------------------DESCRIPTION---------------------
I develop a very famous game. I can say that everybody even a child or a old person, everyone loves this game. The game is TIK TAK TOE. So, I am using Java swing to develop this game. For develop this game I use 2 java files one is the main file and other one is the file that contain some methods for checking the box is empty or not or any user Won or not. The main file Game.java contains 867 lines of code including design and some working codes. And the another file Board.java contains 178 lines of code.  I don’t know how many pages it takes here.
	
Here in this game 2 users are there as you all know. Here user 1 is any user or person or a human being. And another user is the computer itself. And trust me this is not that much easy task to fail the computer. Computer can play very smartly. I assigned some default values to the buttons, here I use 2 means blank, 3 means “X” and 5 means “O”. My game is dependent or based on these 3 values. I use this value onto an 3X3 matrix. As you know that this game has 9 cells so it arranges like a 3X3 matric. So I use 2D array size of 3X3. 

----------------------HOW TO RUN----------------------
To run the game just run the "game.java" file and enjoy the game.
